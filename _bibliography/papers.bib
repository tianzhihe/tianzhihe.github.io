  abstract={Camera-equipped Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are effective tools for as-built building surveys. Through a systematic literature review, we synthesized and categorized factors affecting the quality of UAV-based reconstructed scenes and their associated performance evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy and time efficiency). Their interrelationships were analyzed by Social Network Analysis (SNA) to identify critical factors and their impacts. We further quantitatively evaluated these factors and metrics through controlled experiments with a camera-equipped UAV and a Terrestrial Laser Scanner for an institutional building. Various flight paths, photo overlaps, and distances to the building were tested to evaluate their impact on dimensional accuracy, time efficiency, and point cloud density. We demonstrated the trade-offs between the influential factors to provide insights into parameter selection. Additionally, a data requirements schema for UAV-based as-built 3D scene reconstruction was established toward standardization of data processing practices. This study could serve as a foundation for future research and applications of UAV-based photogrammetry for building surveys.},

  abstract={The growing socio-technical influence of artificial intelligence (AI) is increasing in various dimensions of our daily lives. The monitoring and decision-making role of smart home AI agents could go beyond simple operations, and a lack of users’ trust could lead to the underuse or misuse of their capabilities. As such, lying at the intersection of trust in human-AI interactions and smart home ecosystems, this paper attempts to explore the driving factors of building trustworthy AI-powered smart home ecosystems. To this end, through a systematic literature review, we have identified the characteristics of human-AI trust in intelligent environments, factors that can influence users’ trust in AI, features that can be implemented to improve users’ trust, and challenges and opportunities that need to be considered. The findings can help develop a pathway for building long-term users’ trust in AI-powered smart homes for integrated human-AI interactions.},

  abstract={Virtual assistants powered by Artificial Intelligence (AI) and integrated into the smart home ecosystems facilitate human–building interactions. We have envisioned that the proactive virtual assistant capabilities could be designed to encourage energy conservation behaviours by relying on their nudging effect through conversational interactions, autonomous actuation and guiding users’ decision-making. To this end, we investigated how proactive virtual assistants, in a simulated smart home ecosystem, influence occupants to take energy-saving, adaptive actions for Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) operations and how participants’ personal characteristics affect their responses. Through an interactive online experiment, we collected data from 307 participants from diverse backgrounds across the United States. It was found that proactive communications with follow-up conversations can significantly increase the likelihood of accepting virtual assistance recommendations. This improvement was reflected in an increased number of participants (by 16%) who accepted energy-saving suggestions by comparing initial versus final responses during proactive conversations. Characterizing groups of participants based on their personal features and individual differences showed that user experience (with ∼30% increase), pro-environmental values/beliefs (with ∼24% to 35% increase) and forgiving thermal preferences (with ∼12% increase) had a significant influence on participants’ stated likelihood to accept virtual assistants’ recommendations and their evaluation of the general concept of proactive communication from virtual assistants.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
