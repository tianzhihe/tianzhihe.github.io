  abstract={Camera-equipped Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are effective tools for as-built building surveys. Through a systematic literature review, we synthesized and categorized factors affecting the quality of UAV-based reconstructed scenes and their associated performance evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy and time efficiency). Their interrelationships were analyzed by Social Network Analysis (SNA) to identify critical factors and their impacts. We further quantitatively evaluated these factors and metrics through controlled experiments with a camera-equipped UAV and a Terrestrial Laser Scanner for an institutional building. Various flight paths, photo overlaps, and distances to the building were tested to evaluate their impact on dimensional accuracy, time efficiency, and point cloud density. We demonstrated the trade-offs between the influential factors to provide insights into parameter selection. Additionally, a data requirements schema for UAV-based as-built 3D scene reconstruction was established toward standardization of data processing practices. This study could serve as a foundation for future research and applications of UAV-based photogrammetry for building surveys.},

  abstract={The growing socio-technical influence of artificial intelligence (AI) is increasing in various dimensions of our daily lives. The monitoring and decision-making role of smart home AI agents could go beyond simple operations, and a lack of users’ trust could lead to the underuse or misuse of their capabilities. As such, lying at the intersection of trust in human-AI interactions and smart home ecosystems, this paper attempts to explore the driving factors of building trustworthy AI-powered smart home ecosystems. To this end, through a systematic literature review, we have identified the characteristics of human-AI trust in intelligent environments, factors that can influence users’ trust in AI, features that can be implemented to improve users’ trust, and challenges and opportunities that need to be considered. The findings can help develop a pathway for building long-term users’ trust in AI-powered smart homes for integrated human-AI interactions.},

  abstract={In the past decade, the architecture, engineering, and construction industry has witnessed increasing growth in the green building market and continues to expect a promising future. Although companies in the industry have played a significant role in developing the green building market, scarce studies have analyzed changes in the market from the perspectives of these corporations. Also, few studies classify green building companies by characteristics. To fill these gaps of knowledge, we explored the characteristics of the US green building market from a corporate perspective, specifically investigating green contractors and design firms. We first collected data of 464 top US green building companies identified by the Engineering News-Record over the past decade and explored the development trend of the green building market, based on the green revenue generated by these companies. We found that the general growth trend in the US green building market in the past decade could be divided into three stages: a rapid-growth stage (2000–2008), a steady-growth stage (2009–2013), and a maturity and transformation stage (2014–2016). We then categorized the 464 organizations into three groups with distinct characteristics by k-means cluster analysis techniques, including mature green building companies, sector-oriented green building companies, and primary-stage green building companies. This study provides the academic and practitioner communities with a holistic understanding of the development of the US green building market from the view of burgeoning companies. Corporate-level management systems and sustainable practices of the three clusters of green building companies also provide guidance for construction companies in thevarious stages of transformation towards sustainability to adopt different strategies.},

  abstract={Virtual assistants powered by Artificial Intelligence (AI) and integrated into the smart home ecosystems facilitate human–building interactions. We have envisioned that the proactive virtual assistant capabilities could be designed to encourage energy conservation behaviours by relying on their nudging effect through conversational interactions, autonomous actuation and guiding users’ decision-making. To this end, we investigated how proactive virtual assistants, in a simulated smart home ecosystem, influence occupants to take energy-saving, adaptive actions for Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) operations and how participants’ personal characteristics affect their responses. Through an interactive online experiment, we collected data from 307 participants from diverse backgrounds across the United States. It was found that proactive communications with follow-up conversations can significantly increase the likelihood of accepting virtual assistance recommendations. This improvement was reflected in an increased number of participants (by 16%) who accepted energy-saving suggestions by comparing initial versus final responses during proactive conversations. Characterizing groups of participants based on their personal features and individual differences showed that user experience (with ∼30% increase), pro-environmental values/beliefs (with ∼24% to 35% increase) and forgiving thermal preferences (with ∼12% increase) had a significant influence on participants’ stated likelihood to accept virtual assistants’ recommendations and their evaluation of the general concept of proactive communication from virtual assistants.},

  abstract={With the advancement of the Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, smart homes have promoted human-building interaction and sustainability in occupants’ daily life. The rise of voice-based AI-powered virtual assistants has brought new potentials to provide occupants with a convenient and intuitive interface to interact with smart homes. Aiming at enhancing the human-building bi-directional communication, voice-based proactive virtual assistants integrated with smart home ecosystems—that is, Smart Home Assistants (SHAs)—were investigated in this study. A comprehensive data collection was conducted through an online experiment, in which 307 valid questionnaire responses with participants’ demographic background information and their feedback to proactive SHAs were collected. Occupants’ perception of the proactive SHAs was evaluated among different groups of users with various demographic backgrounds. Five occupants’ socio-demographic background features were identified to have a significant impact on their acceptance level to the energy-saving suggestions by proactive SHAs, including gender, age, education level, employment status, and the number of occupants in a residence. By utilizing these demographic features, ensemble learning models can predict occupants’ perception of proactive SHAs with good performance (accuracy in the range of 0.69–0.75). Findings in this study will provide a valuable reference for academic researchers and industry practitioners in the development of personalized proactive smart home systems for human-building interaction.},

  abstract={Green buildings have gained increasing momentum during the past decade, evidenced by an uptick in green building construction worldwide. To facilitate green building development, it is crucial to understand the current geographical distribution of green buildings, thereby identifying emerging markets and opportunities for future growth. However, very few studies investigated the spatial characteristics of the green building market and the factors influencing the distribution of green buildings. By examining the national green building market in the United States, we studied the spatial distribution patterns and significant influencing factors of the county-level US green building markets. Cluster mapping and hot spots of the green building markets were identified through spatial autocorrelation analysis. A spatial regression model with high performance (of 0.83) was developed to identify the significant influencing factors. We found a statistically significant clustering phenomenon of county-level US green building markets. The spatial error model reveals that three factors, namely, the number of housing units, gross domestic product, and the local green building company index, significantly influence the number of green buildings at the county level. We also found that the county-level green building market is influenced by these factors of not only the host county, but also the neighboring counties. Our findings provide a useful reference for stakeholders’ decision-making process concerning local green building market development.},

  abstract={AI-powered smart homes bring high-quality intelligent services to occupants with digital virtual assistants. Through interactions with occupants, the smart home assistants (SHAs) can develop occupants’ profiles using a number of personal characteristic features for tailored and smart interactions. Based on these profiles, smart home systems can proactively offer automation services while conserving occupants’ comfort and convenience. In this study, we have sought to investigate characteristic features that affect occupants’ perception of the proactive concept, as well as their preferences for modes of interactions through an application of automation for energy efficiency management. Upon a data collection through an online experiment on campus, 58 valid responses with personal characteristic features were utilized to develop predictive machine learning models. These models can predict participants’ general attitude towards proactive SHAs, as well as their preferences for interaction modes with good performance (accuracy between 0.67 and 0.82 and F-score between 0.66 and 0.74). Various features were identified to have considerable significance, including personal beliefs of taking actions and energy expenses, as well as environmental protection values. The findings of this study provide an insight into the design of learning processes for virtual assistants in smart home ecosystems and the effect of the individual characteristics on the users’ preferences for interactions with SHAs.},
