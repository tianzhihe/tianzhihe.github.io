**Welcome!** :smile:

I am a Ph.D. Candidate at [The Charles Edward Via, Jr. Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering](https://cee.vt.edu/) at [Virginia Tech](https://www.vt.edu/). I am currently working with [Dr. Farrokh Jazizadeh](https://www.inform-lab.org/farrokh-jazizadeh) at [Inform Lab](https://www.inform-lab.org/). I am also pursuing an M.Sc. in Computer Science, working with [Dr. Yaxing Yao](http://yaxingyao.com/index.html) at [PASTA Lab](https://pasta.cs.vt.edu/).

I have extensive academic and professional research experience in building information modeling (BIM), human-building interaction, and applied machine learning. 

My research focuses on enhancing human-centered ambient intelligence (AmI) in smart home environments through three main areas: integrating wearable technologies to monitor and adjust to user states for improved well-being, exploring proactive human-AmI interactions with AI Agents, and investigating factors that influence user trust in AmI systems. My research aims to advance how AmI can assist users in achieving daily life goals such as comfort improvement and energy efficiency. 

I am also interested in a range of topics in ***Ambient Intelligence (AmI)***, ***Smart Homes***, ***Conversational AI Agents***, ***Wearable Sensors***, ***Human-AI Trust***, and ***Mixed Reality (VR/AR)***. 

Before joining VT, I obtained my bachelor's degree from Tongji University (Shanghai, China) in 2019.
